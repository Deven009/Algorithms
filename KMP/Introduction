KMP - Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm 

Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science.
When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database,
pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results.
We have discussed Naive pattern searching algorithm in the previous post. 
The worst case complexity of the Naive algorithm is O(m(n-m+1)). 
The time complexity of KMP algorithm is O(n) in the worst case.

 The basic idea behind KMPâ€™s algorithm is: 
 whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), 
 we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. 
 We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match.

 We basically preprocess the pattern array and use it not to match the matched characters when
 mismatch happens.
